  <p>Simple Guidelines for Compassionate and Respectful Interactions</p>
</header>

<section>
  <h2>1. Be Empathetic</h2>
  <p>Listen actively and offer support without judgment. Acknowledge their struggles and show you care through active listening and understanding.</p>
  
  <h2>2. Treat People with Respect</h2>
  <p>Use respectful language and avoid condescending tones. Treat others as equals and show kindness, regardless of their financial situation.</p>
  
  <h2>3. Offer Help Without Imposing</h2>
  <p>Ask if they need assistance rather than assuming. Offering resources like food banks or shelters might be more appropriate than direct charity.</p>
  
  <h2>4. Be Mindful of Non-Verbal Communication</h2>
  <p>Your body language and facial expressions can make a huge difference. Show openness and engage thoughtfully.</p>
  
  <h2>5. Avoid Assumptions</h2>
  <p>Poverty is complex, and it’s important to understand that financial hardship can come from many factors. Approach the situation without preconceived notions.</p>
  
  <h2>6. Be Aware of Your Privilege</h2>
  <p>Recognize the differences in your experiences and act with humility. Don’t make the interaction about your own feelings of goodness.</p>
  
  <h2>7. Offer Long-Term Solutions</h2>
  <p>Instead of just short-term help, consider offering resources or guidance for long-term solutions. This can include job opportunities or educational resources.</p>
